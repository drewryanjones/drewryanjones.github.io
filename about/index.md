title: About Me
---
<div>
<h4>I am a rocket scientist...</h4><p>
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where I design and navigate robotic 
spacecraft missions. The spirit of discovery motivates me, and I am 
deeply in awe by our vast and beautiful cosmos. 
When I am not busy plotting courses among the stars, I enjoy composing 
music on the guitar, mobile game development, hiking, and the enriching 
experience of world travel.</p>

I grew up in the very small town of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson,_Arizona">Benson, AZ.</a> 
This rural setting has incredible clear skies; the 
ever present broad brush stroke of the Milky Way, perhaps 
inspired my fascination with space and the enigmatic concept of
the infinite. I did my undergradte studies at 
<a href="http://www.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a> (ASU).
I received a master degree and a PhD from the  
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>. 
Immediately after school I joined the Mission Design and Navigation Section 
at JPL where I have been ever since!
