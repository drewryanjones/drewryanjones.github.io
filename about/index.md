title: About Me
---
<div>
<h4>I am a rocket scientist...</h4><p>
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where I design and navigate robotic 
spacecraft missions. The spirit of discovery motivates me, and I am 
deeply in awe by our vast and beautiful cosmos. 
When I am not busy plotting courses among the stars, I enjoy composing 
music on the guitar, mobile game development, hiking, and the enriching 
experience of world travel.</p>

I grew up in the very small town of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson,_Arizona">Benson, AZ.</a> 
This rural setting has incredible clear skies; the 
ever present broad brush stroke of the Milky Way, perhaps 
inspired my fascination with space and the enigmatic concept of
the infinite. I began my formal education at
<a href="http://www.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a> (ASU).
And it was a Freshman year dormitory where I met 
my future wife Ashlee, with whom I would share my life and passions.
To this day, ASU is the origin for many of my closest personal 
friendships.</p>

Graduate studies brought me to the 
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>. Austin is 
quite possibly the coolest city in America. We sure enjoyed our time 
there, it is a lively and awesome place to call home. 
Ash and I returned to Arizona in 2013, to be married among friends and 
family.</p>
<p>
Currently, we live in the Los Angeles, California area with our two micro-mini golden-doodles.
They are like the Austin, TX of dog breeds. We love them as our children, 
and enjoy taking them on outdoor adventures. 
Ash and I share a passion for world exploration, via travel. 
Here is a sampling of <a href="/travel">places we have been</a>.
