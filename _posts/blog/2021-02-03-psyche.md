Psyche is a metallic asteroid, a spacecraft, and a NASA mission set to launch in 2022. 
I have the privilege of helping to navigate this exciting "mission to a metal world."
An article about my role on this project is published on

and on 
[Arizona State University's website](https://psyche.asu.edu/2021/02/03/navigating-psyche/).
