title: The exciting future of CubeSats

Space is being invaded by miniature hitchhikers. Small and cheap, 
so-called CubeSats are rapidly becoming more capable, and their missions
more ambitious. CubeSats have typically hitch-hiked to space, riding alongside 
conventional rocketed missions. So far these box-like modular payloads have been 
confined to low-earth orbit (LEO), but this is about to change. 
The LEO barrier will soon be broken, in a variety of unique and innovative ways.

The CubeSat concept was conceived by two professors at 
California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University in 1999. 
Since then the quantity and sophistication of these vehicles has grown 
tremendously, due to commercial-off-the-shelf parts, a standard 
modular interface (with the launch vehicle),  and 
miniaturized electronics (driven in part by the mobile phone industry).
The relative low-cost has permitted amateurs, students, and businesses to enter 
the arena of space, each adding special capabilities and insights. 
Space science and exploration is being democratized, and you (whoever you are)
can and should get involved. 

CubeSats currently provide high-resolution Earth imagery, 
track weather phenomenon, and are being considered as a framework
for global high-speed Internet. But it's the future visions for 
interplanetary flight which really excite me. 
In the next few years, CubeSat's will travel to a 
near-Earth asteroid (NEA) demonstrate solar-sail propulsion, 
look for water deposits on the Moon, and even investigate Mars. 
[NEA Scout](https://www.nasa.gov/content/nea-scout)
is a 6U (6 modular block units) 
solar-sailing vehicle, selected to travel alongside the first 
test flight of the Space Launch System and Orion Crewed Spacecraft 
(EM-1).[^1] Solar-sailing is an awesome form of low-thrust propulsion, 
with incredible potential. A large enough sail could enable us to
reach the stars in a human lifetime! Previously, the 
[planetary society](http://sail.planetary.org) 
demonstrated the use of a solar sail on its 3U Lightsail spacecraft.[^2]

[LunaH-Map](https://asunow.asu.edu/20150825-ASU-LunaH-CubeSat)
is another micro-payload selected for EM-1, and is being 
developed by Arizona State University (my alma mater).[^3] It will orbit 
the Moon, and provide a very detailed map of water deposits near the 
Lunar south pole. 2018 will also see the InSight mission depart for Mars, 
and with it twin CubeSats called 
[MarCO](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.php),
the first interplanetary 
voyagers of their kind. MarCO is a JPL led mission, and will help 
transmit data during InSight's crucial entry, descent, and landing phase.[^4]

The CubeSat revolution is exciting to a mission designer like me, 
because these platforms permit the execution of high-risk technology 
demonstrations. Conventional spacecraft missions, 
consist of a myriad of scientific instruments and goals, and therefore tend 
to be somewhat risk averse. We would not attempt solar sail propulsion demonstration, 
for example, on such a valuable vehicle. But we must somehow push these 
technological boundaries, if we wish to continue to expand the possible frontier. 
Else we will stagnate and become repetitive in our inquiries. 
CubeSats seem to provide the perfect platform for such experimentation. Upon 
their tiny shoulders we might take great risk, and in time realize great reward. 
What began as an educational tool, is now that and more. 
This is a true revolution. I cannot wait to see where it takes us.
