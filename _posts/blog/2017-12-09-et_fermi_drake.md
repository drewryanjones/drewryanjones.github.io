title: Intelligent Aliens, Drake's Equation, and Fermi's Paradox

A tall sentient being adorning a plush crimson robe 
stares up in 
wonderment at an orangish planetary sky
illuminated by three large moons. 
She wonders, "is anyone else out there"? "What strange 
and mysterious creature might be looking back and
contemplating the same thing"?
Homo sapiens from planet Earth, you and I, are what this
hypothetical alien seeks. We seek desperately and deliberately. Yet we hear nothing. 
No feeble sound nor symbolic blip. 
We have been yelling at the top of our 
electromagnetic lungs, and yet no intelligence has heeded our call. 
Where are the aliens? If intelligence is the inevitable masterpiece 
of evolutionary success, why is the Universe not 
reverberating with the calls of conciousness? 
Or is it possible that the benefits of intelligence 
are not so great as we assume, and 
therefore not so widespread?

The puzzling conundrum I have illustrated is known as the 
paradox of Fermi (Fermi-Hart or Hart-Tipler argument). 
The paradox 
[as summarized on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox)
is "the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence 
and high probability estimates
for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations." 
It is not instantly obvious why the probabilities should be high. 
The justifications primarily boil down to laws of large numbers, for 
example consider the estimated 200-400 billion stars in the Milky Way. 
Ludicrously large estimates for the number of 
planetary systems (even the number of Earth-like planets may be 
quite large indeed) mean that advanced life 
could be very rare and yet still be numerous. 
Couple this with the immense time-spans during which civilizations 
could be sending signals and one might expect a crowded zoo 
of chattering life. Moreover, recent discoveries in 
astronomy and biology only increase the seeming abundance of 
potentially life-bearing worlds. In the recent past, we were entirely ignorant 
regarding the existence of planets about other stars and the likelihood 
that such places could support life as we know it. The 
[Kepler space telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html) 
alone has catalogued thousands of exoplanets, and 
Earth-analogues are far-less rare than previously thought. 
The latter conclusion is antithetical to one of the more common 
explanations for the paradox, the "rare Earth hypothesis" or the 
conjecture that habitable planets are highly unlikely. 
The discovery of extremophiles and organisms at deep-ocean trenches 
forced scientists to reevaluate and broaden the prerequisite conditions 
necessary for life. These habitats bring into question the most 
fundamental perceived requirements such as water and 
solar energy. 

So what factors are important in estimating the number of 
intelligent civilizations? In 1961 Frank Drake summarized the 
relevant variables in the following eponymous equation: 

\begin{equation}
N = R * f_p * n_e * f_l * f_i * f_c * L
\end{equation}

where:
* $$N$$: Average number of intelligent (broadcasting) civilizations.
* $$R$$: Average rate of star formation in our galaxy.
* $$f_p$$: Percentage of stars that support planets. 
* $$n_e$$: Average number of habitable planets per star.
* $$f_l$$: Percentage of habitable planets supporting life.
* $$f_i$$: Percentage of planets with life where intelligence emerges.
* $$f_c$$: Percentage of planets with intelligent life that are capable of 
interstellar communication.
* $$L$$: Average years a capable civilization broadcasts.

None of the parameters in 
[Drake's equation](http://www.astrodigital.org/astronomy/drake_equation.html) 
are known with much 
certainty, and generally as one moves from left to right 
the degree of uncertainty increases. 
Drake initially assumed a value of 50% for the number of stars with 
planets, but recent evidence suggests that planets may be more 
the rule than the exception.

My opinion on the paradox is somewhat unconventional.
Specifically, I strongly question the merits (in particular 
the survivability) of human-like intelligence. 
Ironically the same intelligence which motivates me
to pursue knowledge, to explore the cosmos, 
and to write this blog. Could intelligence be a net encumbrance 
rather than an advantage when it comes to long-term survival? 
I believe that intelligence is not only highly unlikely to evolve 
in the first place but also that such cognition is ultimately 
a threat to the continuation of said species. 
This may seem ludicrous at first, but bear in mind we have only one 
data point attesting to the value of high cognition. 
And our species is far too young to make a very strong case for 
long-term survivability. 
Referring to the equation, this means I would assume very small values 
for $$f_i$$, $$L$$, and possibly $$f_c$$. Hence, even if 
$$f_p$$ and $$n_e$$ are relatively large $$N$$ may still be 
small (near zero).
Certainly I acknowledge that our brains have led to the rapid 
and dominating role of humans on Earth. The mind has given us 
music and poetry, the Internet, agriculture, and even the emergence of 
AI. But it has also brought forth the atomic bomb, global warming, and 
religious intolerance. Although dystopian our capacity and willingness 
to destroy others far outpaces the moral maturity required to
circumvent our worst tendencies. 
For most of human history this disparity had minimal consequence.
A stone tool can only cause so much suffering and misery relative to 
its utility. But it seems we are nearing a turning point. 

Today our technologies are gravely consequential, to the point 
where the creations of our collective brain are more perilous than 
anything from nature. 
We live in an age where one mind could decide the ultimate fate of 
all other minds, something evolution could never have envisioned. 
Despite all this, there are numerous positive signs for the 
future of intelligence. And I truly hope I am wrong about its 
ultimate utility. 
One thing is clear: the age of nuclear fusion, AI, and 
interplanetary travel is no place for supernatural superstition, 
nativism, nor economic greed. We must shake 
the limits, biases, and archaic tendencies of our brain and 
begin to think of ourselves as one. Above country, politics, or 
belief system we are the representatives of planet Earth, the 
only ones to speak for our tiny blue paradise in the heavens.
